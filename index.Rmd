# About

My name is Pooja Desai, I'm a third-year Ph.D. student in Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. I am advised by Dr. Lena Mamykina.

My primary research is at the intersection of health informatics and human-computer interaction. My work focuses on developing human-centered AI tools to support maternal health, nutrition, and chronic disease management "in the wild".

I'm particularly interested in context-aware computing, information visualization, and explainable AI systems to support personalized and sustained healthy decision-making.
